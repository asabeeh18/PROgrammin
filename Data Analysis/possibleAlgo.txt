load training data set
for parameters pclass,sex,age-group,(secondaries:sib,parch,ticket fare)
	//calculate d survival % for each categiry(survived/total)
	3 different loops for pclass,sex,age-group
	
		
		
		
		sum total survival rates of each category is the weight
		
		1/sum of weights of all categories is universal multiplier
		
		weights*universal multiplier is the probablity
		
		
 OR
	3 2darrays + 1 1darray in each combination left
		apply similar weight division this tym only 2 weigth 1 for combo 1 for leftover
		
 OR
	1 3d array as given in tut
	
 OR
	Use all 3 of these give each o/p a weight and calculate res.
