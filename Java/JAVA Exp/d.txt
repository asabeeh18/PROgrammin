Dynamic Method Dispatch
A class ‘Shape’ contains two dimensions as dim 1 and dim2, function read which reads the dimensions and function area which returns ‘dim1*dim2’ as default area. Derive class Circle, Rectangle and Triangle from Shape, use the derived functions wherever necessary and override otherwise. Use dynamic method dispatch to find area of each.
Wrapper Class
Crate your own wrapper class ‘MyInt’ which wraps an integer variable. Provide necessary constructors,
 unboxing function and override toString function. Write a program to create two objects of MyInt, adds
 their value, store result in third object and display all.


Multi-threading 2
Create one thread which displays months of the year and second thread which displays days of week. 
Make the program to switch between main and two threads appropriately. Function main has to display 

“Inside main” 10 times. Make sure that the main function finishes only after the two threads finish the task.
Basic Applet
Create an applet to show 5 concentric circles each with varying diameter and filled with different colors.
 Also print the name of color of that circle within its area with some different color.
Passing Parameters to Applet
Create an applet which reads the students information as student name, branch, roll no, date of birth and
 displays the same in vertical columnar position. Create a separate HTML file to keep the applet code and
 values for above data field. Show the execution of the applet with three different HTML files with varying data.
