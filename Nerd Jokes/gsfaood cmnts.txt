One interpretation could be that was the first problem (an extra s). The race condition is the second problem.
Another one mentioned is bad error handling. Some dumb programmer could put something like:
list.append('s')
if (list.lastElement() != 's'): # In case it fails, try again
    list.append('s')

If you really wanted to you could hide DestroyCity() and the function declarations for each public function in a separate dll, so each function was merely a call of DestroyCity(Baghdad). You could go on to write a script that looks up Wikipedia pages for each city function, take a tally of the most frequently used non-filler words filtered through a list of the most common English words, and generate some convincing looking code based off of words picked out that are filtered as keywords, just to make the function look incredibly robust while it is actually quite simple.
All the while you're gaining the experience of making a fudge code generator whilst fooling your inferior superior into giving you job security. And only then can you slack off, being given a success to revel in that makes everything else easy.

Ah, but it can be abstracted further:
Destroy(), which takes an arbitrary object type, which we will signify with Object. An Object can specify actions to be performed as part of its destruction that are specific to its type. An Object of subtype City can, for instance, specify the destruction of its constitutent Building types aaaaand we're Java.

It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a DestroyBaghdad procedure.
The setup suggests it's unethical to write a procedure that destroys an entire city.
Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a DestroyCity procedure, to which Baghdad could be given as a parameter.
The punchline is that it's not unethical to destroy a city, but rather to write a piece of code that only targeted some specific city -- it would have to be rewritten from scratch for any other city, which is highly inefficient.

[–]IraDeLucis 6 points 1 month ago
Much of code development standards and best practices say that anything you write should be reusable, portable.
By writing code that is specifically designed to destroy Baghdad, this code is neither of these things. However, by writing code to destroy a city, where you can tell it which city to destroy, it can then be used over and over under more circumstances than just destroying Baghdad.

A manager, a mechanical engineer, and software analyst are driving back from convention through the mountains. Suddenly, as they crest a hill, the brakes on the car go out and they fly careening down the mountain. After scraping against numerous guardrails, they come to a stop in the ditch. Everyone gets out of the car to assess the damage.
The manager says, "Let's form a group to collaborate ideas on how we can solve this issue."
The mechanical engineer suggests, "We should disassemble the car and analyze each part for failure."
The software analyst says, "Let's push it back up the hill and see if it does it again."

[–]James20k 12 points 1 month ago
Processors have a pipeline, where they perform multiple steps for instructions in the future, before finally executing the instruction. This allows them to increase throughput
Branching screws this up fantastically, a processor doesn't know which branch the execution path is going to take at runtime, and this completely messes with the pipeline (It has to get cleared which causes stalling as it gets refilled)
To cope with this, you have speculative execution/branch prediction which guesses which branch will be taken, and begins executing down that branch. If the processor successfully guesses the branch, you don't have to clear the pipeline (woop performance boost). If it doesn't, you get the pipeline stall
The joke is pretty great really. We have our first statement "Knock knock", and a branch "Who's there?". The branch prediction executes "Branch prediction" before the answer to "Who's there?" has come in fully. So its a branch prediction joke about branch prediction
Its not really a programming joke about a specific language

He prepares a cup for either case, because if he had a full cup if he gets thirsty and no cup at all if he doesn't, then the two outcomes would have different types.
Edit: I should mention that this joke really applies only to statically typed languages. In a dynamically typed language (like JavaScript), there would be no problem with returning a full cup in one case and nothing at all for the other case.
Edit2: As the guy who is not a banana pointed out, "no problem" only means the code will run, not that it's ever good style!

It's actually possible to reach zero bugs in this song -- just repeat until you reach 4294967296 bugs. Integer overflow will bring you to zero (assuming you're working in 32 unsigned bits).

This is not about CPUs, it's about programming. 32 bit is still quite common for integers. But of course you can also use 16 bit or 8 bit data types, why the hell not?

[–]chloroform_vacation 9 points 1 month ago
Seriously though, when you deal with large amounts of data you can't just plunk everything into doubles and expect the user to have sufficient ram for all the unused bits. So it's sometimes crucial to consider a smaller type. And it all depends on what precision you're counting on. If it's near 0 there's no point using doubles over say floats etc...

[–]Intrexa 15 points 1 month ago
I use 64 bits for bool values. If it's 0x0000000000000000 it's false, but if it's 0x0000000000000001 it's true. Because I'm such a good defensive coder, if it's any other value it's clearly an error, and I raise an exception.

We're not talking about operating systems here. Using the smallest required variable type reduces the memory footprint of the program you're creating. If you know the variable you're assigning will always be a whole number between 0-255, you might as well make it an unsigned 8-bit integer instead of a 32-bit float or 64-bit double float. It doesn't make much of a difference when you're writing a simple "Hello World", but when you start manipulating large amounts of data, you shave off whatever you can whenever you can.

No, that's pretty much the idea. It's just the fact that the solution causes more problems than the original problem, and how that happens pretty frequently in programming.

After the lecture, one of the men leaned over and grabbed a woman’s breast.
Woman: Hey! That’s private OK ?

A man flying in a hot air balloon suddenly realizes he’s lost. He reduces height and spots a man down below. He lowers the balloon further and shouts to get directions, "Excuse me, can you tell me where I am?"
The man below says: "Yes. You're in a hot air balloon, hovering 30 feet above this field."
"You must work in Information Technology," says the balloonist.
"I do" replies the man. "How did you know?"
"Well," says the balloonist, "everything you have told me is technically correct, but It's of no use to anyone."
The man below replies, "You must work in management."
"I do," replies the balloonist, "But how'd you know?"*

I got a good one, happened last week to a client that is halfway across town.
"My computer bluescreens every time it starts up then it's slow"
I get over there to find out the bluescreen is the blank blue desktop that windows xp loads before the login screen, and the OS loads so slow because every app the user installed on their own, they threw a shortcut in the "startup" folder in the start menu, so they know which programs to load when they log in.

[–]rexxfiend 126 points 1 month ago
As much as I hate to be pedantic (ahem)..
It should be nine, not seven. Seven (0111) and eight (1000) both have an odd number of bits so there wouldn't be a parity discrepancy. Nine (1001) has an even number of bits so there would actually be a parity error.
Having said that, that is one of my favourites, even if it's always told wrongly ;-)
permalinkparent

I always understood it to be referring to 7/8 bits. Pieces of 7 is missing the parity bit, the 8th bit (which, yes, isn't actually a parity error).

A decent programmer should absolutely love CSS. Yes, some of the terminology in it is a bit esoteric and there are a lot of funny nuances...and getting everything to play nice across all browsers isn't fun.
But CSS is just such a beautifully executed concept. Being able to separate style from content in such a way is incredibly useful.
Check out http://www.csszengarden.com/ for a demonstration of how awesome CSS can be.

For the non computer literate and mathamaticaly challanged.
Oct (Or Octal) is a counting system using only 8 numbers.
While Dec (Or Decimal) is your typical counting system using 10 numbers (0,1,2 etc)
there are others used in programing most commonly used (or known).
Is Hex (Or Hexadecimal) that uses 16 numbers (7,8,9,A,B).

A physician, a civil engineer, and a computer scientist were arguing about what was the oldest profession in the world. The physician remarked, "Well, in the Bible, it says that God created Eve from a rib taken out of Adam. This clearly required surgery, and so I can rightly claim that mine is the oldest profession in the world."
The civil engineer interrupted, and said, "But even earlier in the book of Genesis, it states that God created the order of the heavens and the earth from out of the chaos. This was the first and certainly the most spectacular application of civil engineering. Therefore, fair doctor, you are wrong: mine is the oldest profession in the world."
The computer scientist leaned back in her chair, smiled, and then said confidently, "Ah, but who do you think created the chaos?"

A young Programmer and his Project Manager board a train headed through the mountains on its way to Wichita. They can find no place to sit except for two seats right across the aisle from a young woman and her grandmother. After a while, it is obvious that the young woman and the young programmer are interested in each other, because they are giving each other looks. Soon the train passes into a tunnel and it is pitch black. There is a sound of a kiss followed by the sound of a slap.
When the train emerges from the tunnel, the four sit there without saying a word. The grandmother is thinking to herself, “It was very brash for that young man to kiss my granddaughter, but I’m glad she slapped him.”
The Project manager is sitting there thinking, “I didn’t know the young tech was brave enough to kiss the girl, but I sure wish she hadn’t missed him when she slapped me!”
The young woman was sitting and thinking, “I’m glad the guy kissed me, but I wish my grandmother had not slapped him!”
The young programmer sat there with a satisfied smile on his face. He thought to himself, “Life is good. How often does a guy have the chance to kiss a beautiful girl and slap his Project manager all at the same time!”

At a recent computer software engineering management course, the participants were given an awkward question to answer:
"If you had just boarded an airliner and discovered that your team of programmers had been responsible for the flight control software, how many of you would disembark immediately?"
Among the ensuing forest of raised hands only one man sat motionless. When asked what he would do, he replied that he would be quite content to stay aboard. With his team's software, he said, the plane was unlikely to even taxi as far as the runway, let alone take off.

An engineer, a physicist and a programmer are flying around in a Cessna when suddenly the engine fails. The plane struggles to maintain altitude. They think they will die in a fiery crash when they notice an open field. They glide and make an emergency landing.
The engineer says, "I'll go check the engine and see what's wrong"
The physicist gets up and says, "There is no need for that. We can look at thrust, drag, lift, acceleration, wind speed, friction, heat and a couple of other parameters and figure out why the engine failed."
At this point, the programmer gets up, looks at the other two like they're morons and says, " Guys, it might not even be a real issue. Why don't we fly it again and see if it's reproduceable?

Jesus and Satan have an argument as to who is the better programmer. This goes on for a few hours until they come to an agreement to hold a contest with God as the judge. They set themselves before their computers and begin. They type furiously, lines of code streaming up the screen, for several hours straight.
Seconds before the end of the competition, a bolt of lightning strikes, taking out the electricity. Moments later, the power is restored, and God announces that the contest is over. He asks Satan to show his work. Visibly upset, Satan cries and says, “I have nothing. I lost it all when the power went out.”
“Very well,” says God, “let us see if Jesus has fared any better.”
Jesus presses a key, and the screen comes to life in vivid display, the voices of an angelic choir pour forth from the speakers.
Satan is astonished. He stutters, “B-b-but how?! I lost everything, yet Jesus’ program is intact! How did he do it?”
God chuckles, “Everybody knows Jesus saves.”

A man walks into a pet shop and sees 3 monkeys, each in a cage, each with a computer. The man is curious and walks up to the clerk and asks - what is the story with the moneys?
"They are programming monkeys - for example this one here can complete 100 lines of C++ in an hour - only 100$"
The first monkey was busy typing away, and sure enough it was flawless code.
They moved onto the second monkey who was typing even faster.
"This monkey knows Java, C++ and helped develop Julia - 1000$ for this one".
"What about that last monkey in the biggest cage?" the man asked.
"well he is 10000$'s...."
"That's must be an amazing monkey! What does he do?", the man asked.
"Well, when he was brought in all he did was sit there while the other monkeys worked, so we figured he must be executive management."

[–]muskratio 7 points 1 month ago
It's not as much of a myth as you think! Python has issues with tail recursion, because the compiler does no tail call optimization, despite the fact that it would be extremely easy to add and not make the compiler any less efficient (only make tail recursive code more efficient... and possible). This is by design. Guido has personal issues with tail recursion - he thinks it makes stack traces more complicated. He's not wrong, but it's bizarre that he thinks that's so important he would make it impossible to use a pretty standard programming method in his language. However, he's nearly militant about it. He not only refuses to put it into Python, he has actually "banned" anyone from writing a Python compiler that implements TCO (which doesn't necessarily stop them, by the way).
SO, you're right - you can change the recursion depth. But it's still going to run more and more slowly and take up more and more unnecessary resources the larger your loop is. While you can make it keep going, you can't make it do a good job. Functionally, Python does have shitty recursion depth. It would be almost nothing to remove this weakness from Python, but Guido has a personal vendetta, so....

A guest speaker used that joke as his opener at a banquet I attended in college.
The banquet was being held by the campus chapter of the Society of Women Engineers. The joke did not go over well.

[–]Sykotron 10 points 1 month ago
I understand the ') is closing what's suppose to be the input string so it can then inject other SQL, but why is the -- important? Just to make sure that any further SQL isn't executed? Why would that matter: the table's already been dr... ah, to omit and potential rollbacks?
permalinkparent
[–]phobos00000 18 points 1 month ago
If the original query you're injecting into was
UPDATE foo SET (bar = '?') WHERE baz = 100;
without the -- the new query would be
UPDATE foo SET (bar = 'Robert'); DROP TABLE Students;') WHERE baz = 100;
which is invalid SQL, and would not be executed. The -- comments out the remaining portion of the original query.

"Which raises the question ... what is the difference between a computer programmer and an Al Qaeda cell member?
Hmmm. One is a religous zealot with an abiding disdain for the average American citizen, thinly-veiled fear of women, deep unresolved emotional issues, an ever-growing desire to halt all trade and contact with people on the other side of the world who threaten their way of life, an inclination toward working -- undetected -- late at night, extreme objections to many recent actions by the U.S. government, a predilection toward passionate intra-sect divisions over seemingly trivial matters of doctrine, and an operational setup placing him in a cell cut off from communication with other members of his organization.
The other is a terrorist working for Osama bin Laden.

A computer programmer crosses a road when a frog calls out to him, "If you kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess."
He bends over, picks up the frog and puts it in his pocket. The frog speaks up again and says, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess, I will stay with you for one week."
The computer programmer takes the frog out of his pocket, smiles at it and returns it to the pocket.
The frog then cries out, "If you kiss me and turn me back, I'll do whatever you say!"
Again the computer programmer takes the frog out, smiles at it and puts it back into his pocket.
Finally, the frog asks, "What is the matter? I've told you I'm a beautiful princess, I'll stay with you for a month and do whatever you say. What more do you want?"
The computer programmer says, "Look, I'm an computer programmer . I don't have time for a girlfriend, but a talking frog, now that's cool!"
