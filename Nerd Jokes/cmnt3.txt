Jesus Saves
--- from novinite ---
Jesus and Satan have an argument as to who is the better programmer. This goes on for a few hours until they agree to hold a contest with God as the judge.
They set themselves before their computers and begin. They type furiously for several hours, lines of code streaming up the screen.
Seconds before the end, a bolt of lightning struck taking out the electricity. Moments later, the power is restored, and God announces that the contest is over. He asks Satan to show what he has come up with.
Satan is visibly upset, and cries, "I have nothing! I lost it all when the power went out."
"Very well, then," says God, "let us see if Jesus fared any better."
Jesus enters a command, and the screen comes to life in vivid display, the voices of an angelic choir pour forth from the speakers.
Satan is astonished. He stutters, "But how?! I lost everything, yet Jesus' program is intact! How did he do it?!"
God chuckles, "Jesus saves."

A woman asks her husband, a programmer, to go shopping.
Wife: “Dear, please, go to the nearby grocery store to buy some bread. Also, if they have eggs, buy 6.” Husband: “O.K., hun.”
Twenty minutes later the husband comes back bringing 6 loaves of bread. His wife is flabbergasted.
Wife: “Dear, why on earth did you buy 6 loaves of bread?” Husband: “They had eggs.”

For a class I took we had to do a project for a local company. In order to make it efficient, we set up a wiki were both groups in the class could put their questions, before sending them to Bill at the company. The first set of questions was called "jQueries for Bill". The second set was called "jQueries for Bill part 2: the SQL".

He flies to Africa, picks up the first thing he sees and asks "Are you an elephant?" and repeats.

Is it really pronounced "vie" (like pie), instead of "vee" (like "she")? I always pronounced it "vee".

I pronounce it 'vee-aye', basically spelling it.

[–]marrone12 5 points 1 month ago
it is indeed!
from wikipedia: The name vi is pronounced /'vi?'a?/[3][4][5] (as in the discrete English letters v and i), or /'va?/.[6]
