Best poem ever, from bash.org:
A programmer started to cuss
Because getting to sleep was a fuss
As he lay there in bed
Looping 'round in his head
was: while(!asleep()) sheep++;

A pessimistic programmer sees the array as half empty.
An optimistic programmer sees the array as half full.
A Real Programmer sees the array as twice as big as it needs to be and calls realloc().

Three programmers walk into a bar. The bartender asks them if they all would like a beer.
I don't know, the first programmer replies.
I don't know, chimes the second programmer.
Yes, says the third programmer.
C was trying to cheer Java up after his split with his girlfriend, but it was no use. Java never released memory.

Kinda Poor Joke:
Boy and girl of same class. Boy opens a girl's purse in front of her without permission. Girl : 'WTF you are doing, guys don't open girl's purse without her permission.'. Boy: 'Members of same class can access the private variables of others.'

A C programmer and a python programmer are roommates and go out to a bar. By some stroke of fate, they manage to bring girls back. Things get heated in the bedrooms, but, being programmers, neither knew how to take a bra off. Their respective girls, being understanding, showed them how to do it. The python programmer interpreted her actions interactively, then kept going. The C programmer sat motionless for a few minutes. When his girl asked him whats wrong, he simply said 'compiling'.
