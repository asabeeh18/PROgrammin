Some people, when confronted with a problem, think, 'I know, I'll use threads' - and then two they hav erpoblesms.

Knock knock.
Race condition.
Who's there?

A programmer is told to "go to hell", he finds the worst part of that statement is the "go to"

"go to heaven" is even worse because heaven is up and you NEVER NEVER use a GOTO to a upper line of code.

Not the funniest, but this one came to mind:
"It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a DestroyBaghdad procedure. Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a DestroyCity procedure, to which Baghdad could be given as a parameter." - Nathaniel Borenstein

If you really wanted to you could hide DestroyCity() and the function declarations for each public function in a separate dll, so each function was merely a call of DestroyCity(Baghdad). You could go on to write a script that looks up Wikipedia pages for each city function, take a tally of the most frequently used non-filler words filtered through a list of the most common English words, and generate some convincing looking code based off of words picked out that are filtered as keywords, just to make the function look incredibly robust while it is actually quite simple.
All the while you're gaining the experience of making a fudge code generator whilst fooling your inferior superior into giving you job security. And only then can you slack off, being given a success to revel in that makes everything else easy.

A manager, a mechanical engineer, and software analyst are driving back from convention through the mountains. Suddenly, as they crest a hill, the brakes on the car go out and they fly careening down the mountain. After scraping against numerous guardrails, they come to a stop in the ditch. Everyone gets out of the car to assess the damage.
The manager says, "Let's form a group to collaborate ideas on how we can solve this issue."
The mechanical engineer suggests, "We should disassemble the car and analyze each part for failure."
The software analyst says, "Let's push it back up the hill and see if it does it again."

He prepares a cup for either case, because if he had a full cup if he gets thirsty and no cup at all if he doesn't, then the two outcomes would have different types.
Edit: I should mention that this joke really applies only to statically typed languages. In a dynamically typed language (like JavaScript), there would be no problem with returning a full cup in one case and nothing at all for the other case.
Edit2: As the guy who is not a banana pointed out, "no problem" only means the code will run, not that it's ever good style!

I get over there to find out the bluescreen is the blank blue desktop that windows xp loads before the login screen, and the OS loads so slow because every app the user installed on their own, they threw a shortcut in the "startup" folder in the start menu, so they know which programs to load when they log in.

Q: What did the Project Manager say to the Programmer?
A: You start coding, I'll go find out what they want.

A biologist, a statistician, a mathematician and a computer scientist are on a photo-safari in Africa. They drive out into the savannah in their jeep, stop and scour the horizon with their binoculars.
The biologist: "Look! There's a herd of zebras! And there, in the middle: a white zebra! It's fantastic! There are white zebras! We'll be famous!"
The statistician: "It's not significant. We only know there's one white zebra"
The mathematician: "Actually, we know there exists a zebra which is white on one side"
The computer scientist: "Oh no! A special case!"

More importantly, you also need to catch a hairNotFoundException in the event that the user is bald. Or more properly, wrap the whole thing in "if(hair != null)". You don't want bald users throwing an exception every time they shower.

A physician, a civil engineer, and a computer scientist were arguing about what was the oldest profession in the world. The physician remarked, "Well, in the Bible, it says that God created Eve from a rib taken out of Adam. This clearly required surgery, and so I can rightly claim that mine is the oldest profession in the world."
The civil engineer interrupted, and said, "But even earlier in the book of Genesis, it states that God created the order of the heavens and the earth from out of the chaos. This was the first and certainly the most spectacular application of civil engineering. Therefore, fair doctor, you are wrong: mine is the oldest profession in the world."
The computer scientist leaned back in her chair, smiled, and then said confidently, "Ah, but who do you think created the chaos?"

A young Programmer and his Project Manager board a train headed through the mountains on its way to Wichita. They can find no place to sit except for two seats right across the aisle from a young woman and her grandmother. After a while, it is obvious that the young woman and the young programmer are interested in each other, because they are giving each other looks. Soon the train passes into a tunnel and it is pitch black. There is a sound of a kiss followed by the sound of a slap.
When the train emerges from the tunnel, the four sit there without saying a word. The grandmother is thinking to herself, ìIt was very brash for that young man to kiss my granddaughter, but Iím glad she slapped him.î
The Project manager is sitting there thinking, ìI didnít know the young tech was brave enough to kiss the girl, but I sure wish she hadnít missed him when she slapped me!î
The young woman was sitting and thinking, ìIím glad the guy kissed me, but I wish my grandmother had not slapped him!î
The young programmer sat there with a satisfied smile on his face. He thought to himself, ìLife is good. How often does a guy have the chance to kiss a beautiful girl and slap his Project manager all at the same time!î

At a recent computer software engineering management course, the participants were given an awkward question to answer:
"If you had just boarded an airliner and discovered that your team of programmers had been responsible for the flight control software, how many of you would disembark immediately?"
Among the ensuing forest of raised hands only one man sat motionless. When asked what he would do, he replied that he would be quite content to stay aboard. With his team's software, he said, the plane was unlikely to even taxi as far as the runway, let alone take off.

An engineer, a physicist and a programmer are flying around in a Cessna when suddenly the engine fails. The plane struggles to maintain altitude. They think they will die in a fiery crash when they notice an open field. They glide and make an emergency landing.
The engineer says, "I'll go check the engine and see what's wrong"
The physicist gets up and says, "There is no need for that. We can look at thrust, drag, lift, acceleration, wind speed, friction, heat and a couple of other parameters and figure out why the engine failed."
At this point, the programmer gets up, looks at the other two like they're morons and says, " Guys, it might not even be a real issue. Why don't we fly it again and see if it's reproduceable?

Jesus and Satan have an argument as to who is the better programmer. This goes on for a few hours until they come to an agreement to hold a contest with God as the judge. They set themselves before their computers and begin. They type furiously, lines of code streaming up the screen, for several hours straight.
Seconds before the end of the competition, a bolt of lightning strikes, taking out the electricity. Moments later, the power is restored, and God announces that the contest is over. He asks Satan to show his work. Visibly upset, Satan cries and says, ìI have nothing. I lost it all when the power went out.î
ìVery well,îù says God, ìlet us see if Jesus has fared any better.î
Jesus presses a key, and the screen comes to life in vivid display, the voices of an angelic choir pour forth from the speakers.
Satan is astonished. He stutters, ìB-b-but how?! I lost everything, yet Jesusí program is intact! How did he do it?î
God chuckles, ìEverybody knows Jesus saves.î

A man walks into a pet shop and sees 3 monkeys, each in a cage, each with a computer. The man is curious and walks up to the clerk and asks - what is the story with the moneys?
"They are programming monkeys - for example this one here can complete 100 lines of C++ in an hour - only 100$"
The first monkey was busy typing away, and sure enough it was flawless code.
They moved onto the second monkey who was typing even faster.
"This monkey knows Java, C++ and helped develop Julia - 1000$ for this one".
"What about that last monkey in the biggest cage?" the man asked.
"well he is 10000$'s...."
"That's must be an amazing monkey! What does he do?", the man asked.
"Well, when he was brought in all he did was sit there while the other monkeys worked, so we figured he must be executive management."

The following jokes probably have a very high "79 104 44 32 121 111 117 33 0" effect, but anyway:
Why do most C++ programmers stop after one child?
Because multiple inheritance is a headache.
Why did the Lisp programmer get a new car?
He ran out of storage space
Why do Haskel programmers avoid most medicines?
Because they have side-effects
Why do the stories written by C programmers drag on forever?
Because they can't write closures.
When is a door not a door?
When it's a GenericStaticFurnitureBase
Why did the Python programmer not respond to the foreign mails he got?
Because his interpreter was busy collecting garbage.
